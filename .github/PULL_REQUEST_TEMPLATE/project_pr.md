# Project Pull Request

This template is for any submissions to our [projects list](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/PROJECTS.md).
If you're submitting a pull request for any other part of the repo, don't use this
template.

Before you submit your project, there's a few things to check:

* Have you followed the [code of conduct?](https://github.com/ossu/code-of-conduct)
* Does this project violate the honor code of one of the courses in OSSU?

If you've followed those two guidelines, then prepare a pull request for the project
and a post for our Discord. Put the post in the [#projects channel](https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/881778556961701909),
and ensure it contains some details for the community:

* The description of the project.
* Any courses or resources that were particularly helpful that you'd like to share.
* Any learnings that you had while doing the project.
* Questions that you have for the group, or any feedback you'd like to receive.

If that's all good, create the pull request and send over your Discord post. Thanks!
